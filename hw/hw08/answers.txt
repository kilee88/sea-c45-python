Homework 8

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296

Problem 3:

It would give the error stating that the gc_count is not defined since on the if statement, it adds continually adds to each other. But without the gc_count being stated and having no value, it has nothing to go by.

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.5689938518518518

Problem 5:

C - content 5879128
G - content 5738773
A - content 7701287
T - content 7661547

Problem 6:

The sum count doesn't match the total count because the total count contains hidden chracters. To fix it where they match, you would have to change and use the sum_count instead of total_count to get it matching.

Problem 7:

AT/GC - ratio 1.3223416174746196

Collaboration:

I got confused on certain parts of the assignment and asked a friend for help. His name is Chong Park and he has been amazing as a support and as a friend and helped me understand that assignment better.

Reflection:

I learned the potential of what these programs can do. It was able to sort through so much information and obtain key information. This is such a valuable tool and we can, in the future make more things like this. I think the lesson here helped show me what you can achieve with this skill.
