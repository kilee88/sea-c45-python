# My name is Ki Lee. I am excited to learn Python through Codefellows. Although difficult, I believe that one day I can be a great programmer like our instructors and help others. 

### I want to devote this new skill in creating things that can emit joy to others. As a child, I had lived and breathed the game Pokemon. It's my goal to make a game or something similar that can create many good memories for others.
